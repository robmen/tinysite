title: This Title is > "Title Override"
tags: ignored

The title for this blog entry is `This Title is > "Title Override"`.
By default the title comes from the filename. However, you can override
the title by adding the `title` metadata to the header of your blog
entry to use a different title.

This feature is designed to allow you to put characters in the title
that cannot be use in file names. In the case of this blog entry, that
character is the `>`.

Note that the "slug" for the document will still be based on the
filename, not the title metadata. In this case, the slug for the
document is `title-override`.
