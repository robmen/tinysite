date: 2014-4-5

By default blog posts are organized by the date in their filename. For
example, this blog post filename started with `2014-04-04`. However,
just like with [title], you can use the `date` metadata to override
the date.

We don't have a real use case for this but thougth it best to keep
things consistent.
