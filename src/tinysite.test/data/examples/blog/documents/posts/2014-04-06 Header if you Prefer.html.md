You don't usually have to, but you can use the YAML document markers
`---` (three dashs) to set apart the header of the document from the
rest of the document. It is important to use the explicit markers if you
want to have blank lines between items in the header.

Otherwise, you can leave out the markers and just get to writing what
is important... the document content.
